    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is an amazing story from a flight attendant on Delta Flight 15, written following 9/11:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> On the morning of Tuesday, September 11, we were about 5 hours out of Frankfurt, flying over the North Atlantic.<br /> <br /> All of a sudden the curtains parted and I was told to go to the cockpit, immediately, to see the captain. As soon as I got there I noticed that the crew had that \"All Business\" look on their faces. The captain handed me a printed message. It was from Delta's main office in Atlanta and simply read, \"All airways over the Continental United States are closed to commercial air traffic. Land ASAP at the nearest airport. Advise your destination.\"<br /> <br /> No one said a word about what this could mean. We knew it was a serious situation and we needed to find terra firma quickly. The captain determined that the nearest airport was 400 miles behind us in Gander, New Foundland.<br /> <br /> He requested approval for a route change from the Canadian traffic controller and approval was granted immediately--no questions asked. We found out later, of course, why there was no hesitation in approving our request.<br /> <br /> While the flight crew prepared the airplane for landing, another message arrived from Atlanta telling us about some terrorist activity in the New York area. A few minutes later word came in about the hijackings.<br /> <br /> We decided to LIE to the passengers while we were still in the air. We told them the plane had a simple instrument problem and that we needed to land at the nearest airport in Gander, New Foundland, to have it checked out.<br /> <br /> We promised to give more information after landing in Gander. There was much grumbling among the passengers, but that's nothing new! Forty minutes later, we landed in Gander. Local time at Gander was 12:30 PM....that's 11:00 AM EST.<br /> <br /> There were already about 20 other airplanes on the ground from all over the world that had taken this detour on their way to the US.<br /> <br /> After we parked on the ramp, the captain made the following announcement: \"Ladies and gentlemen, you must be wondering if all these airplanes around us have the same instrument problem as we have. The reality is that we are here for another reason.\"<br /> <br /> Then he went on to explain the little bit we knew about the situation in the US. There were loud gasps and stares of disbelief. The captain informed passengers that Ground Control in Gander told us to stay put.<br /> <br /> The Canadian Government was in charge of our situation and no one was allowed to get off the aircraft. No one on the ground was allowed to come near any of the air crafts. Only airport police would come around periodically, look us over and go on to the next airplane.<br /> <br /> In the next hour or so more planes landed and Gander ended up with 53 airplanes from all over the world, 27 of which were US commercial jets.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, bits of news started to come in over the aircraft radio and for the first time we learned that airplanes were flown into the World Trade Center in New York and into the Pentagon in DC.<br /> <br /> People were trying to use their cell phones, but were unable to connect due to a different cell system in Canada. Some did get through, but were only able to get to the Canadian operator who would tell them that the lines to the U.S. were either blocked or jammed.<br /> <br /> Sometime in the evening the news filtered to us that the World Trade Center buildings had collapsed and that a fourth hijacking had resulted in a crash. By now the passengers were emotionally and physically exhausted, not to mention frightened, but everyone stayed amazingly calm.<br /> <br /> We had only to look out the window at the 52 other stranded aircraft to realize that we were not the only ones in this predicament.<br /> <br /> We had been told earlier that they would be allowing people off the planes one plane at a time. At 6 pm, Gander airport told us that our turn to deplane would be 11 am the next morning.<br /> <br /> Passengers were not happy, but they simply resigned themselves to this news without much noise and started to prepare themselves to spend the night on the airplane.<br /> <br /> Gander had promised us medical attention, if needed, water, and lavatory servicing.<br /> <br /> And they were true to their word.<br /> <br /> Fortunately we had no medical situations to worry about. We did have a young lady who was 33 weeks into her pregnancy. We took REALLY good care of her. The night passed without incident despite the uncomfortable sleeping arrangements.<br /> <br /> About 10:30 in the morning of the 12th a convoy of school buses showed up. We got off the plane and were taken to the terminal where we went through Immigration and Customs, and then had to register with the Red Cross.<br /> <br /> After that we (the crew) were separated from the passengers and were taken in vans to a small hotel. We had no idea where our passengers were going. We learned from the Red Cross that the town of Gander has a population of 10,400 people and they had about 10,500 passengers to take care of from all the airplanes that were forced into Gander!<br /> <br /> We were told to just relax at the hotel and we would be contacted when the US airports opened again, but not to expect that call for a while.<br /> <br /> We found out the total scope of the terror back home only after getting to our hotel and turning on the TV, 24 hours after it all started.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we had lots of time on our hands and found that the people of Gander were extremely friendly. They started calling us the \"plane people.\" We enjoyed their hospitality, explored the town of Gander and ended up having a pretty good time.<br /> <br /> Two days later, we got that call and were taken back to the Gander airport. Back on the plane, we were reunited with the passengers and found out what they had been doing for the past two days.<br /> <br /> What we found out was incredible...<br /> <br /> Gander and all the surrounding communities (within about a 75 kilometer radius) had closed all high schools, meeting halls, lodges, and any other large gathering places. They converted all these facilities to mass lodging areas for all the stranded travelers.<br /> <br /> Some had cots set up, some had mats with sleeping bags and pillows set up.<br /> <br /> All the high school students were required to volunteer their time to take care of the \"guests.\"<br /> <br /> Our 218 passengers ended up in a town called Lewisporte, about 45 kilometers from Gander where they were put up in a high school. If any women wanted to be in a women-only facility, that was arranged.<br /> <br /> Families were kept together. All the elderly passengers were taken to private homes.<br /> <br /> She was put up in a private home right across the street from a 24-hour Urgent Care facility. There was a dentist on call and both male and female nurses remained with the crowd for the duration.<br /> <br /> Phone calls and e-mails to the U.S. and around the world were available to everyone once a day. During the day, passengers were offered \"Excursion\" trips.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people went on boat cruises of the lakes and harbors. Some went for hikes in the local forests.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> Local bakeries stayed open to make fresh bread for the guests.<br /> <br /> Food was prepared by all the residents and brought to the schools. People were driven to restaurants of their choice and offered wonderful meals. Everyone was given tokens for local laundry mats to wash their clothes, since luggage was still on the aircraft.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> In other words, every single need was met for those stranded travelers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> Passengers were crying while telling us these stories. Finally, when they were told that U.S. airports had reopened, they were delivered to the airport right on time and without a single passenger missing or late. The local Red Cross had all the information about the whereabouts of each and every passenger and knew which plane they needed to be on and when all the planes were leaving. They coordinated everything beautifully.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> It was absolutely incredible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> When passengers came on board, it was like they had been on a cruise. Everyone knew each other by name. They were swapping stories of their stay, impressing each other with who had the better time. Our flight back to Atlanta looked like a chartered party flight. The crew just stayed out of their way. It was mind-boggling.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> Passengers had totally bonded and were calling each other by their first names, exchanging phone numbers, addresses, and email addresses.<br /> <br /> And then a very unusual thing happened.<br /> <br /> One of our passengers approached me and asked if he could make an announcement over the PA system. We never, ever allow that. But this time was different. I said \"of course\" and handed him the mike. He picked up the PA and reminded everyone about what they had just gone through in the last few days.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> He reminded them of the hospitality they had received at the hands of total strangers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> He continued by saying that he would like to do something in return for the good folks of Lewisporte.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;He said he was going to set up a Trust Fund under the name of DELTA 15 (our flight number). The purpose of the trust fund is to provide college scholarships for the high school students of Lewisporte.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> He asked for donations of any amount from his fellow travelers. When the paper with donations got back to us with the amounts, names, phone numbers and addresses, the total was for more than $14,000!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> The gentleman, a MD from Virginia, promised to match the donations and to start the administrative work on the scholarship. He also said that he would forward this proposal to Delta Corporate and ask them to donate as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> As I write this account, the trust fund is at more than $1.5 million and has assisted 134 students in college education.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> \"I just wanted to share this story because we need good stories right now. It gives me a little bit of hope to know that some people in a faraway place were kind to some strangers who literally dropped in on them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> It reminds me how much good there is in the world.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> \"In spite of all the rotten things we see going on in today's world this story confirms that there are still a lot of good people in the world and when things get bad, they will come forward.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /> *This is one of those stories that need to be shared.

There are different ways to whitening your teeth&mdash;toothpastes, over-the-counter gels, rinses, strips, and trays, but you can also remove food, beverage, and smoking stains with laser teeth whitening and a mixture of baking soda and lemon juice.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Smile Designing</strong>: Snapchat and Instagram have us showing off our best side.

They have <a href=\"/blogcomment.php?id=PHpaMALkc0\">ditched the traditional means of traveling</a> for unique experience on a budget. Their tech-savvy minds have pushed the air industry to transform air travel.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Expedia recorded that professionals between 18 and 30 years go on an average five business trips a year. 62 percent of millennials choose bleisure that is, extending their business trip into a vacation. They are likely to opt for loyalty programs than older generations.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MUrgency Airport Assistance has several services that are great for millennial business travelers. We are your one-stop shop for airport service in 136 countries.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Demand for Business Center</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The last two decades has seen an exponential growth of start-ups, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. Most of them are millennials who work round the clock. Staying connected with the team and clients are of utmost importance to them. Hence a business center with great connectivity, stationary and devices are the need of the hour for them.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lounge Access</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />They believe in unwinding in style after a hard day&rsquo;s work and what better way than the airport lounge. They also believe in getting the best value for their money and hence always looking for sweet deals. Erik Conover, a YouTuber recently discovered a great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAjmRx2lCMY&amp;t=8s\">airport lounge for $45</a> that has a gym, spa, and an excellent swimming pool. Want to know more? Be it access to first class lounge or getting cost-effective deals for such first class lounge, no airports&rsquo; hidden secrets are hidden from us.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Upgrade</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Frequent business flyers are always looking for upgrades. An excellent example is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84WIaK3bl_s\">Neistat Casey</a>, a top YouTuber that showed the world an unbelievable upgrade. For such travel class upgrades, connect with our representative. They also offer re-booking a flight in case of cancellation, change in plan, or missed flight.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fast Track</strong><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Time is of utmost importance to them. And security and immigration can be eat up most of the time on a business trip. In order to avoid lines at passport control and custom clearance (where applicable), they at times opt-in for the fast track process. However, each airport varies depending on the specific rules of airports, airlines and countries.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Millennials may be ruling the roost, but Gen Z is the future and their opinions, habits, and behavior will further shape air travel.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Liked the article?

First off, avoid drinking alcohol. It is difficult to refuse free drinks. Alcohol may put you to sleep, but only for a few hours. And you are likely to wake up with a headache and thirsty.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for food, go light and small. Eating a big and greasy meal just before you want to sleep is a bad idea. It makes it difficult to digest, making you restless and uneasy. It is also believed that heavy meals cause the blood to clot, not the best scenario for long haul flights.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Window Seat</strong>: The view is unbelievable, but the window seat is also a secret remedy for good sleep. You can lean your head on the side of the plane, which works if you do not have a neck pillow. Also, you are at an advantage of controlling the light.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Sitting Position</strong>: It feels great to sit crossed leg, but it can cause clots over long flights. What you can do is keep your legs straight, bend the knees slightly, so blood does not pool in the lower part of your body. For people with smaller build, tilt your entire body to the side, so your shoulder is in the seat.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The worst thing about sleeping on the plane is back pain. Either recline the seat to support your lumbar or sit straight, only if your lumbar is strong.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plan Ahead</strong>: When you fly, you move over different time zones, so it is important to correct the time zones. At least a week before your scheduled flight, change your sleep patterns. If you are flying east sleep and wake up early. If you are flying west, delay your sleep, so wake and sleep later than the regular time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Comfort Clothing</strong>: Create a comfortable environment&mdash;wear pajamas, carry a blanket, cardigan, and eye mask.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Liked the article?

Travel is an enriching experience.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take it from <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/travel-graduation-regrets/1342254/\">Naomi Chadderton</a>, who regrets missing out on post-graduation traveling. She like most college graduates had a checklist for life. Graduate, get a job in the city, get married, and buy a picketed fence house.

Get discounts for flight tickets, food, entrance, tours, and parking. All you need is an international student ID or unexpired universities ID. You will not get these discounts till you are a senior, that&rsquo;s a long wait.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Time</strong>: You have a lot of time after college graduation, make the best of it with traveling&mdash;an enriching experience. Before starting a new chapter and getting a job that will nail you to your work, take a break.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Money Matters</strong>: After graduation, you have to learn to be fully independent. Taking a trip throws you in the deep end and gets you out of your comfort zone. You learn to budget and manage your money and won&rsquo;t have money for necessities. You will learn to prioritize what you can live without.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Travel On Budget</strong>: When you have limited money, you look for cheaper accommodation and cost effective way to get meals. Hostels and dorms are few options, but it is a great way to meet new people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Healthy</strong>: These are the years, where you are healthy, activity, and raring to go. What better way to see the world.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Less Responsibilities</strong>: Once you get a job, family, and house you have bills and mortgages to pay. This is the only time you have least responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At MUrgency Airport Assistance we understand the necessities of travel.

If you are flying east sleep and wake up early. If you are flying west, delay your sleep, so wake and sleep later than the regular time. This method is a luxury, but if you can change your sleep pattern even a bit while balancing work and other commitments, then you can beat jet lag.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2) Stopovers Helps</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Layover, transit, or stopover&mdash;unknowingly, they help you adjust to the time difference. When you reach your stopover, take advantage of the time zone and adjust with it. This will help you feel less tired and groggy when you reach your destination.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3) Snooze On The Flight</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Follow the pattern of your destination. If it is night at that particular time of your new location, then sleep. It can be hard to fall asleep on the plane, so create a comfortable environment&mdash;wear pajamas, carry a blanket, cardigan, and eye mask. Eat and sleep on the flight based on the time zone your new location is based. If it is day time, use these hours to relax.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4) Gadget Friendly</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have to stay awake, stay plugged in. The logic behind is that the light emitted from your device is akin to sunlight, so it rewires your body clock and keeps you awake. Vice versa, you can use your phone or tablet to fall asleep. Download one of the various apps that offers a red filter that prevents the light and lulls you into sleep.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5) No Alcohol</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alcohol dehydrates. The air in the plane also dehydrates. Put them together and you will feel uneasy, groggy, unwell, and awake. If you are trying to nap, alcohol will disrupt it. Drink plenty of water to counteract the feeling of dehydration, before and on the flight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6)&nbsp; No Caffeine</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Caffeine before a flight or on the flight can disrupt your sleep pattern if you are trying to adjust the body clock to a different time zone. This property can last in your system, maximum, 14 hours in some cases. If you want to sleep, caffeinated drinks are not the best choice.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7) Sun, sun, sun</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you reach your destination, enjoy daylight. This is one of the quickest way to align your body clock. Sunlight ensures your circadian rhythm modifies to your new location.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Tricks of the trade</strong></em>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When traveling west, soak in the sun in the morning, but avoid it in the afternoon. When traveling east, enjoy the afternoon sun, and avoid daylight in the morning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>8) Block Your Sleep</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get a minimum of four hours of sleep at a stretch at your destination. This is a process that will get you adjusted to your time zone. If you can, get the regular hours of sleep you would have on a given day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>9) On Short Trips</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a matter of few days, stick to your daily scheduled of sleep. It will be easier to get back to work without the feeling of lethargy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>10) Fitness Level</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is one of the least known tips to beat jet lag. Your fitness level dictates how well you can cope with jet lag after you land. Exercise, eat healthy, and get a lot of rest before you get on a flight. Your stamina and conditioning predicts your level of coping with jet lag.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jet lag is a temporary problem and it will last on the number time zones you have crossed. <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/hp.asp\">Medicinenet.com</a> suggests that &lsquo;the body clock will adjust to the new time zone at the rate of one or two time zones per day.

    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before you board a flight, you have to patiently pass through several airport procedures, and find your gate through the airport&rsquo;s labyrinth. The airport procedures are standard for domestic and international airports, but if you are traveling via a major airport, it is an overwhelming journey. The rush and lengthy lines can test your patience and leave an impact.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, you can ace air travel conveniently and smoothly with these pointers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Luggage Requirements</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ensure the weight and size of the luggage adheres to the airline&rsquo;s requirements, before you head to the airport. This information is available on the airline&rsquo;s website. It provides you information for what you can pack in your carry-on bag and cost of excess luggage or check-in bags.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Get To The Airport Early</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are a first time flier, give yourself enough time to familiarize with the in and out of the airport. Airports offer multiple days parking, reservation, and shuttle service. Plan ahead of time and take into account traffic. Give yourself a buffer time; two hours for a domestic flight and three hours for an international flight. However, crosscheck the airline website for the details.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Porter Service</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of lugging your heavy bags as you maneuver through the airport, get a porter service.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Personal Escort</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a great service for first time flier. Make your trip at the airport a pleasant and stress free one with the help of a personal escort, who will meet and greet you at the curb. He or she will guide you through the airport procedures, right up to the boarding gate.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Check-in</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the first step at the airport. You can save time with online check-in or wait in line at the airline&rsquo;s check-in counter. Many major airports in the world also have self-service check-in kiosk that prints out your boarding pass. Here&rsquo;s an example of how to use a check-in kiosk:</p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJev2tNDYxU?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Security Check</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look for signs to the security line. Here you will have to take off your shoes, belt, jackets, laptop, carry bag, watch, etc., and place it in the plastic bin to be scanned. You will be asked for identification and boarding pass.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Immigration</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is an important step at the international airport. The officer with scan your documents, passport, click your pictures, and at some places scan your fingerprints. Stay calm and answer the officer&rsquo;s questions that may include what is the purpose of your visit, duration of your stay, and who are you visiting.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fast Track</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Going through check-in, security, and immigration, means you have to stand in long lines. However, you can skip the lines with the help of fast track service. You are given priority over other passengers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lounge</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you are done, you can relax at the airport lounge. Get in touch with us for airport lounge access. Why sit at the uncomfortable airport seats or sip on overpriced coffee. At the lounge, the food is top quality and the seating is the most comfortable for your back. You can spend rejuvenate at the spa, take a shower, and take a nap.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find Your Gate</strong>:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your boarding pass will have the gate number or you can check the electronic display. Simply, follow the signs to your gate and wait for the boarding to start.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are new to the airport procedures, head to the airport early so you are not huffing and puffing to the boarding gate. First time fliers can arrange for airport assistance to have a smooth trip. Check out <a href=\"http://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/\">MUrgency Airport Assistance</a>.

The amenities varies from airport-to-airport, lounge-to-lounge, but you can count on spa, shower, buffet, drinks, newspaper, magazine, and Wi-Fi.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Porters</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Leave your bags to porters. They efficient handle light, bulky, heavy or multiple items of luggage at the airport. They are available at departure and at arrival terminals.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Fast Track</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The air travel industry is expanding rapidly, so are the lines. What you need is fast track access. It gives you first preference for the different airport procedures such as security, customs, and immigration. Get ahead on the lines with fast track access; perfect for frequent business traveler.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Expedited Security Screening</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Few people take advantage of this service. In the USA, you can request for TSA PreCheck for $85. It permits pre-approved passengers to access designated fast-track security line for five years. It saves you the hassle of taking off the belt, shoes, and jacket at the security line.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Reserve Shopping</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />If you are looking for a gift for your clients, you can pre-book the item from the duty free and pick it up on your way out. Some airports allow you to pay in advance, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the currency. You just have to produce your flight ticket and passport at the counter.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Baggage Delivery</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />This service allows you to make the most of your business trip. Your luggage is picked up and delivered to the assigned address. You can head from the airport to the meeting, so you skip dropping off the bags at the hotel.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Mid-Week Flights</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Another way to ensure airport lines are short, is traveling during the week. The surge of air passengers is visible between Friday to Sunday. Though your schedule is chalked out, aim at flying on Tuesday or Wednesday to beat the rush.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Check-In Online</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />The trick here is to check-in the moment the flights open this service. It ensures you do not have to wait in long lines at the ticket counter and you have a chance to upgrade.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Currency</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />No time to exchange currency? Airports will do it for you in advance. You simply order your money online and pick it up at the airport.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />MUrgency Airport Assistance is one such company that can organize and arrange for these services at 626 airports in the world.

Geocaching is your answer to find the city&rsquo;s secrets, making your guidebook an out-dated copy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1YTqitVK-Ts?rel=0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>WWOOF</strong>: Sometimes you just want to get out of the concrete city and into the quiet, green pastures of the country. <a href=\"http://wwoofinternational.org/\">World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms</a> lets you do exactly that.

Believe it or not, it is home to several amusement parks. You can walk along the beach or learn about Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s rich history at one of the many museums. So, let&rsquo;s break it down on the fun things tourists can do in Jeddah:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1) Corniche</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When in Jeddah head to the Red Sea.

The best time to visit it is in the evening, where the fountain is at its best with the backdrop of the setting sun.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3) Floating Mosque</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another iconic monument at the Corniche is the Floating Mosque, which stands majestically at the north Corniche. The mosque is called the White Mosque as it is adorned with white marbel exterior, but step inside to experience the exquisite interiors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4) Balad</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you like architecture, this place offer unique style that dates back 2,500 years and was home to fishermen.

    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your heart races when you cannot spot your luggage on the baggage carousel. It is either lost or someone has taken it. Even when the airline finds your lost bags, how can prove that it is yours, especially if the tag is torn? What items in the bag can prove the bag belongs to you? Also, a lot of suitcases look similar, someone else can walk away with it, unknowingly.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several ways to identify your suitcase and tying a ribbon is not one of them.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) The biggest identifier is a <strong>business card</strong>. Drop it in your bags, so you can prove it belongs to you. The business card has your contact details, so the bags can be returned to you, in case someone mistakenly takes it.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) Before your leave for the airport, <strong>take pictures of the luggage</strong> from different angles.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) Buy a <strong>bright colored suitcase</strong>&mdash;yellow, neon, or something funky that can be spotted even when you are tired.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) <strong>Place your itinerary</strong> in the pocket of the bag. Works great if your bag has a common design and someone can walk away with it.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) Where your personality on your bags. Attach a <strong>colorful or unique tag</strong> that can be spotted from a distance.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6) Get a <strong>luggage belt</strong>&mdash;it stops your bag from bursting at the seams and works as an identifier.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7) Doll up the bags with many <strong>stickers</strong>.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8) Tape it up. Use a <strong>decorative duct tape</strong> on the luggage. Avoid the regular silver tape, which again is common.

    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are flying more than 40,000ft in the sky, anything can go wrong. The flight attendants have basic training to administer first aid or deliver a baby. Case in point, is when <a href=\"/blogcomment.php?id=JFZ4cCl8RB\">Turkish Airlines crew</a> help a mother deliver her premature baby successfully. However, the airline staff and crew are not trained to evaluate and pinpoint a passenger&rsquo;s condition. That is when they request if there is a doctor on board to approach the staff.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The question remains: do you have to pay the doctor for the services or does the airline pay for it?</strong></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Good Samaritan Law</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an emergency, this law protects doctors. <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=21915\">Medicinenet</a> defines it as, &lsquo;A law designed to protect a Good Samaritan from legal liability. Such laws usually specify that whoever in good faith provides emergency (and sometimes non-emergency) medical services shall not be civilly liable unless their acts constitute wanton misconduct.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alan Pinshaw, Obstetrician Gynecologist and Medical-legal Consultant at Harvard Medical School explains on Quora, the benefits and limitations of the law.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The &ldquo;Good Samaritan Law&rdquo; offers legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or they believe to be injured or ill or in peril. The principles contained in these laws generally operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is English Common Law. Whatever the circumstances might be fear of litigation would seem to me to be an anemic excuse for withholding medical assistance from someone in need.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, any doctor on board can volunteer to save lives or assist in the patient&rsquo;s care. This brings us back to the question on payment.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Money Or Kind</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In cases of emergencies, the airline nor passenger pays the doctor or specialist. Gregory Walter, an American Physician recounts his experience. He had to assess the patient and determine the course of the flight. It all went well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, &ldquo;The patient thanked me and I went on my way. I had not done much but I felt that I had done something good, something thankless and that made my day. The thought of compensation never entered my mind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a token of appreciation, he was present with a gift. &ldquo;As I left one of the flight attendants gifted me a bottle of wine. That was a nice gesture. I had that bottle for about a year. Every time I saw it, I smiled and it reminded me of something nice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Legal Exemptions</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another physician, Dr. Ray Schilling explains in detail the legalities involved. &ldquo;There is a legal advantage of not getting paid: if we had been wrong and the patient had died of a heart attack, we could have been sued for malpractice as we practiced medicine (we had been paid for the service). When the health professional does not get paid for the service, he/she cannot be sued because of some legal rules that have been established long time ago (the Good Samaritan clause).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Gratitude</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A good deed in the doctor&rsquo;s book, but a biggest reward is saying &lsquo;Thank You&rsquo;. A gesture of gratitude is what the Good Samaritan needs and encourages them to help people. Even if the situation turns for worse, passengers need to realize they are working on limited resources. We thank you doctors for your service.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Liked the article?

    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are an English-speaking person that has to travel to China. The first thing to hit you is the language. The signs, symbols, and language are completely different and you are thrown out of your comfort zone. Most European countries have similar alphabets, which makes it easier to read and pronounce. The challenging languages are the Asian ones. Hindi, Mandarin, and Arabic is nothing what you are used to, but that should not stop you from traveling to these amazing countries. All you need are these tools to overcome language barriers for your next business trip, solo adventure, or vacation.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Google Translate</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />There are several apps that help you translate spoken language, text from an image, or typed. Google Translate is one of them and works great offline. Download the language and you can save common, everyday phrases you would use in the phrasebook such as thank you, sorry, excuse me, and greetings. These etiquettes will go a long way and help you get out of any situation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />However, not all language-translating apps are 100 percent accurate. Grammar and the local lingo can differ from the results of the app. What you could do is translate it in to one language, and then reverse-translate it for the right phrase.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pointing </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />It sounds absurd, but it goes a long way if you cannot understand complex sentences. Some hand gestures may be offensive, so do your homework before visiting the country. However, pointing is a universal way to show what you want. It is an action that we have developed as toddlers, when we couldn&rsquo;t speak. It worked for us then, it works for us now too.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pointing is great for indicating direction, places on the map, menu, and at the store.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Calculator</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Numbers are generic in most languages. 2+2=4, if you can read this you can travel to most countries. The challenge to understanding numbers is when it is spoken. That is when the good ol&rsquo; calculator comes to use. It works well to denote purchases, bargaining, and bus routes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />However, if the numbers are in Japanese, Russian, or Bhutanese you need another alternative. You don&rsquo;t have to learn a new language to read numbers, simply, remember the zero to nine symbols.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />These are the sure shot ways to get around town and overcome the language barrier. It&rsquo;s ok to get lost and overwhelmed with a new language, so stay calm and download a language translator, point, and don&rsquo;t forget the calculator (everyone has one on their mobile).</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>",

    "title": "should you book flight ticket directly with airline or travel agent?",
    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>This has crossed our minds before booking the tickets. We are always looking for the best deal and cheap flight tickets. Millennials prefer to make their own decisions and sway towards booking tickets directly with the airline. A number of people still book through a travel agent. So which deal is better? Every service has its pros and cons, so what are the <strong>benefits of booking with a travel agent or directly with the airline</strong>. We find out what we gain and lose in the process.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Book Directly With The Airline</strong></p>\r\n<p><br />Airlines has seen a surge in people booking directly with the airlines. One of the biggest reasons is that many airlines offer <strong>special fares for direct booking on airline websites</strong>. It cuts out the travel agents and brings down the cost of the flight tickets.</p>\r\n<p><br />Secondly, you get complete <strong>ownership of the airline reservation code</strong>, when you directly book the ticket. It is a huge benefit as you can manage your reservation, cancel a trip or issue a refund. You can also transfer control to someone else. It gets a major plus point if you have to re-book a ticket. When you book the ticket via a travel agent, the airline will tell you to approach them to re-book it, because they cannot edit it. Without the reservation code the airline cannot change your ticket, only the travel agent.</p>\r\n<p><br />It is easier to <strong>get a refund directly from the airline</strong>, rather than go through a long process, mostly months, of emails and phone calls with the travel agent.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br />Book Through A Travel Agent</strong></p>\r\n<p><br />If you are not sure about a trip, a travel agent has the liberty to <strong>hold a flight ticket for 24 hours</strong> for free, or avail of the <strong>24-hour refund</strong>. Travel agents have a special privilege available only to them&mdash;almost every airline allows them to void a ticket for one day after the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><br />They also can <strong>offer cheaper tickets</strong>. This is where it gets interesting. Travel agents can negotiate with the airline to lower cost if it is bulk order. For example a corporate team. Some travel agents buy a bulk of tickets at a lower price than that advertised on the airline&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n<p><br />When traveling to a remote country or island, an international commercial may land at the nearest international or major airport. You would have to book another local flight to get to your destination. This is where the travel agents have an edge. They can <strong>create an itinerary to book different flights on one reservation code</strong>. It is a package deal that we look for at the end of the day.</p>\r\n<p><br />If you are still confused which service is better, let&rsquo;s narrow it down:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Easy and direct trips, book directly with the airline.</li>\r\n<li>Complicated itinerary, a travel agent would be better.</li>\r\n<li>For short-notice trip, got with the travel agent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />At the end, the decision rests on you to get the best deal for great price and service. Read the fine print and make a decision.</p>\r\n<p><br />Liked the article?

If you are flying in a private plane or if you are a medical flight, your aircraft needs an extra dose of TLC. The plane is layered with snow and ice, which is not good for it. The runway is piled with snow and the weather reduces visibility. To sort out these issues and more on a cold, snowy day, you need the assistance of a ground handling team. Their services ensure you land and take off without a glitch.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>De-Icing</strong>: It is not just removing snow before takeoff. The plane has areas that are instrumental in taking off and should be free from contaminants. The build-up of snow also adds extra weight, disrupts the flow of air, which impacts takeoff and flying. Snow can disrupt the movement of the wings' flaps and ailerons.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The de-icing takes place at the de-icing pad, where the plane is sprayed with a heated orange fluid called Glycol. Here&rsquo;s a video of detailed methodology of de-icing a plane:<br /><br /></p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/arRCtRJRm_o?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Weather Monitoring</strong>: The ground handling staff ushers you to the runway when the weather is poor. They are also the eyes and ears for the pilots. They ensure you have the best possible landing and takeoff.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Clearing Runway</strong>: On a snowy day, the runway is piled not only with snow, but also with ice. This can be dangerous for landing and taking off. You can count on the staff to clear the run from snow and ice formation.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some airports use chemical deicers to melt the ice, which is applied after clearing the runway and taxiway edges, so the lights are not buried. It is interesting to note that ice melting compounds such as potassium chloride is used as it is less harmful to the aluminum skins of the planes.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Traction On Snow</strong>: Just as with cars and other vehicles, the airplane also needs additional accessories to gain traction on snow. The ground handling staff provides tractors, tugs, and the necessary cables to steer the plane safely.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ground handling services go an extra mile when it snows and it is much appreciated.

However, flying during the Holiday Season is a stressful time, especially for families, grandparents, minors traveling alone, or moms traveling with kids.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For regular fliers, the passage through an airport terminal tests your patience; it is tougher for families. First, find parking, then search for the terminal, wait for your turn at check in, stand in serpentine line at passport control, and rush to your boarding gate. All this while dodging passengers and shoppers at duty free. What you need is a pass to expedite the airport procedure, get lounge access, and concierge to escort you in the quickest way to your boarding gate. Family assistance at the airport sums up all these services and ensures a stress free and comfortable journey through the airport.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Family assistance is a broad term that covers various airport services for parents, grandparents, and children. Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Airport Assistance For Parents Traveling With Kids</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spending Christmas with grandparents is an ideal way for kids to bond with them, and grandparents to cherish new memories. When flying out for Christmas holidays, you do not need a <a href=\"http://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/blog/rY0NzAtT2j/Survival-Guide-For-Parents-Flying-With-Kids\">survival guide to survive the airport</a>. Stay relaxed at the airport with fast track to speed through airport procedures or concierge service to navigate through the airport. The concierge service can be customized to meet your needs and requirements. The representative will guide you to the play area, baby changing room, and gain access to the lounge. <a href=\"http://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/requestform\">Book the service</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Airport Assistance For Grandparents</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the family can&rsquo;t fly out to meet the grandparents, grandparents will come to you. You know you will have great food over the Holiday Season too. However, the rush of passengers at the airport during the busiest time of the year can take a toll on them. To ease the tension, grandparents and elderly couples can travel comfortably with meet &amp; assist service. The representative will escort you from the curb to the boarding gate with ease and arrange for wheelchair or cart transportation through the terminal. Whatever your needs, the representative will cater to it, so that air travel is convenient. <a href=\"http://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/requestform\">Book the service</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Airport Assistance For Unaccompanied Minor</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your child is flying alone, our representative ensures they feel safe and they have a memorable experience.

Take into account alternative airports at favorite summer destinations such as New York, Bali, Rome, Greece, Paris, Amsterdam, London, Barcelona, Thailand, and Jamaica. The reason being: cheaper flight tickets, avoid the crowd, and shorter lines at check in, passport control, security, and customs. During summer, airports are stressful, which can drain the excitement from your vacation. So, why not book flights to an alternative airport near these popular summer vacation destinations. Following is a list of airports that ensures a smooth, easy and relaxing trip.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>New York </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)</strong> is the primary airport serving the bustling New York city. However, it is one of the busiest airports in the world and busier during summer and holidays. To avoid the rush and have a stress-free trip, book your flights to and from the neighboring airports. Such as:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>LaGuardia Airport (LGA)</strong>, which is situated at the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Islip or Long Island MacArthur Airport (ISP)</strong>, which is based at Long Island, in Ronkonkoma, Town of Islip.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Stewart International Airport (SWF)</strong> is approximately 60 miles north of Manhattan and situated at southern Hudson Valley, west of Newburgh, New York</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Rome</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The city of Rome has intrigued many for centuries and the allure of Rome continues till today. Rome and Italy welcome numerous tourists from all over the world during summer. This leads to frustratingly long lines at all airport procedures at the <strong>Leonardo da Vinci International Airport or Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO)</strong>. However, modify your itinerary to land in Italy at these alternative airports:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Florence Airport, Peretola (FLR) or Aeroporto di Firenze-Peretola</strong> was formally Amerigo Vespucci Airport. This international airport serves the capital of the Italian region of Tuscany.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Venice Airport Marco Polo (VCE)</strong> is the gateway to one of the most romantic cities in world.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Milan&ndash;Malpensa Airport (MXP)</strong>, formerly City of Busto Arsizio Airport is the second busiest airport in Italy.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Athens</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is one of the most picturesque summer destinations in the world. Sun kissed beached, amazing culture, great food and wine, and excitement. Athens, Greece has the perfect combination of fun in summertime. However, the <strong>Athens International Airport \"Eleftherios Venizelos\" (ATH)</strong> sees an influx of tourists in summer. But you can make your way to either of the Greek airports:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Mykonos International Airport (JMK)</strong> serves the Mykonos Island&mdash;a popular destination for tourists.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Syros Island National Airport (JSY)</strong> caters to the Syros Island in Greece and also called Syros National Airport &lsquo;Demetrius Vikelas&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Milos Island National Airport (MLO)</strong> is situated at Milos, which is an island in the Cyclades.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Paris</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Come summer, this French city will be bursting with activity, life, culture and love. Paris has always been a romantic and summer destination with ever nationality. People from all over the world make a beeline to the France&rsquo;s busiest and largest airport, the <strong>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) or Roissy Airport</strong>. However, to accommodate this influx for passengers, Paris has alternative airports to ease the summer rush.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Paris Orly Airport (ORY) or Orly</strong>, is an international airport located partially in Orly and partially in Villeneuve-le-Roi, 7 NM south of Paris, France.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Beauvais&ndash;Till&eacute; Airport (BVA)</strong> is known as Paris-Beauvais Airport. It is an international airport near Beauvais.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Amsterdam</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The weather is perfect in summer in Amsterdam, which makes it a great destination to unwind and relax. A vacation in Amsterdam is perfect for friends, solo travelers, and family. However, to beat the rush at <strong>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS)</strong> direct your itinerary from this airport and breeze through it:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Eindhoven Airport (EIN)</strong> is the second largest airport in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Barcelona</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spain has the perfect combination of culture, wine, food, sun, and beaches. If you wish to avoid the crowds at the <strong>Barcelona&ndash;El Prat Airport (BCN)</strong> here are few alternative airports near Barcelona.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Reus Airport (REU)</strong> is located by the beaches of Costa Daurada.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Girona&ndash;Costa Brava Airport (GRO)</strong> is easily accessible to the Costa Brava and the Pyrenees.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Thailand</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is favorite destination for Asian, Australians, and New Zealanders. This top summer destination attracts a lot of people and the best gateway to this paradise is through the <strong>Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK)</strong>. However, the other option is: <strong>Don Mueang International Airport (DMK).</strong></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Jamaica</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can never go wrong with a vacation on Jamaica&rsquo;s beaches and relaxed atmosphere. It is just what you need after months of working. Jamaica&rsquo;s life and nature attracts tourists from far and wide. <strong>Sangster International Airport (MBJ)</strong> is the main hub for international flights arriving and departing from Jamaica.

You are in the driver&rsquo;s seat when it comes to selecting the flight, seat, and food. So, do you still need a travel agent in 2018? What use are they when you have online services? They are around for a good reason.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Travel agents live and breathe on travel itineraries. They are the source of knowledge when it comes to planning an itinerary from A to Z.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also can offer <strong>cheaper tickets</strong>. This is where it gets interesting. Travel agents can negotiate with the airline to lower cost if it is bulk order. For example a corporate team. Some travel agents buy a bulk of tickets at a lower price than that advertised on the airline&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When traveling to a remote country or island, an international commercial may land at the nearest international or major airport. You would have to book another local flight to get to your destination. This is where the travel agents have an edge. They can create an itinerary to book different flights on <strong>one reservation code</strong>. It is a package deal that we look for at the end of the day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The travel industry is vast and the clients counts on the travel agent for <strong>information and best deals</strong>. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to know what are the hottest, latest, hippest, trendiest hotels in the major cities and who&rsquo;s got the best-chef restaurants. You have to know and speak with experience to these people, because they really want the very best that&rsquo;s out there, and they want to know that you know what their choices are,&rdquo; explains Jill Romano, owner of <a href=\"http://www.dimensionsintravel.com/\">Dimensions in Travel Inc</a>. This is the reason why travel agents are the best choice to plan your itinerary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Booking through a travel agent makes life less stressful, <strong>save time and money</strong>. The travel understands your requirements and budget, and prepares an itinerary around it. Plus, they are offered discounts through promotions, so this helps you cut cost. So, you get the best deals for the best price.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Travel agents are <strong>your shield against frauds</strong> ranging from hotels, airline tickets, cruises, insurance, and other services for your journey. You are insured for medical emergencies and trip cancellations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Travel agents are not obsolete and they are going to be there to serve you. They are your Pinterest, Expedia, and AirBnB rolled one.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Liked the article?

    "content": "<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Holiday season is one of the most stressful times and worst so for air travelers. When flying to meet your family and relatives, you cannot escape the stressful situations at the terminal such as long lines and the crowd. They only drain you out from all the holiday season fervor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to <a href=\"https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/america_on_the_go/us_holiday_travel/html/entire.html\">US Department of Transportation</a>, &lsquo;The Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year&rsquo;s holiday periods are among the busiest long-distance travel periods of the year. During the six-day Thanksgiving travel period, the number of long-distance trips (to and from a destination 50 miles or more away) increases by 54 percent, and during the Christmas/New Year&rsquo;s Holiday period the number rises by 23 percent, compared to the average number for the remainder of the year.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest reasons American travel during the holidays because they are visiting friends and family. These visits amounts to 53 percent of all Thanksgiving long-distance trips and 43 percent of long-distance trips during Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Passengers traveling during the holiday season are younger compared to passengers during the rest of the year. The Thanksgiving travelers&rsquo; average age of are under 34 years and for Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s holiday travelers, the average age is slightly above 36 years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Airport Assistance by MUrgency has monitored the holiday season in the US over the years and these are the best way to escape the maddening rush and ordeal at US airports.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) <strong>How to Make Baggage Hassle Free</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Airlines and airports have strict regulations on baggage, which works to our disadvantage during the holiday season. Size and weight limitations; and what you can carry in your hand luggage or carry on, makes packing for the holiday an arduous process. Passing through airport security is an agonizing part of the flight, but we need it for our safety. So, the best thing to do is do not wrap the gifts. Save the wrapping for the end, in case, TSA wants to inspect the gift. Read the other tips on <a href=\"http://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/blog/wPZvM54BWU/Holiday-Season-Hacks:-How-To-Travel-With-Gifts-At-The-Airport\">how to travel with gifts at the airport</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) <strong>Airport Services</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holiday season is one of the busiest times for air travel and the best way to expedite the passage through the crowd is with airport assistance. For a quick and swift route through the airport, book fast track. To welcome family or friends or if you need guidance at a US airport, book meet &amp; assist. The representative will happily escort you to your vehicle or boarding gate. This service is ideal for first time travelers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other airport services include lounge access, VIP concierge, baggage handling, limousine service, and much more. Check the <a href=\"/ourservices\">complete list of airport assistance services here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) <strong>Plan For Delayed Flight</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heavy snowfall and poor visibility are the two main reasons delayed or cancelled flights. There are four ways to go about if you are in these situations:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>Re-booking: If you have miles, this is the best time to redeem it and ensure you get a seat when the weather clears out.</li>\r\n<li>Book A Hotel: Get a hotel room near the airport or reserve a room at the airline&rsquo;s designated hotel.</li>\r\n<li>Airport Assistance: If you know your travel plans will coincide with the weather&rsquo;s plan, get the help of airport assistance to create plan B.</li>\r\n<li>Lounge Access: If you have to spend few hours at the airport at least till the weather clears out get lounge access.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) <strong>Go Online Before Heading To The Airport</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are different ways to cut short your time at the check in counter. Do an online check in online&mdash;24 hours before your scheduled flight and print your boarding pass at home. Some airports have self-check in kiosks too, which reduces time spent at the airline counter. These steps also secure your seat, double-check changes for the flight timing, and reduces your chances of getting bumped in an overbooked flight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your smartphone is the biggest assistance. You can check in from your smartphone and use a digital bar code on the screen to pass through the airport.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) <strong>Get To The Airports On Time</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Expect traffic heading to the airport during these months. So, leave early for the airport or book an airport shuttle or limousine to pick you up and efficiently handle your luggage. In this case, you know, you will reach on time and never miss your flight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enjoy the holiday season with your loved ones and leave the hassle of air travel to airport assistance team.

However, Melbourne is Australia&rsquo;s sports capital that hosts sporting events all year round. The city has welcomed sportspersons and enthusiasts, students, and business people alike. Hence, the Melbourne Airport has seen a rapid growth in passengers in this decade. In September 2017, <a href=\"http://www.melbourneairportassistance.com/\">Melbourne Airport</a> jumped seven percent in air passengers. Approximately 931,000 people flew internationally as compared with 870,000 the previous year. This trend has given rise to better airport facilities and services such as fast track, meet &amp; assist, concierge, etc. to take the stress out of traveling to this southern continent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lyell Strambi, the Chief Executive at <a href=\"https://www.melbourneairport.com.au/\">Melbourne Airport</a> told Herald Sun, &ldquo;Melbourne&rsquo;s rapidly growing population, and its attractiveness to international visitors, is combining to drive passenger volumes higher month after month.&rdquo; However, the capacity is going to increase, which has increased investments in the aviation sector.

That&rsquo;s where airport assistance services comes to your rescue such as fast track, meet &amp; assist, cart transport inside the airport, etc. These are some of the services that ensure you make a quick passage through all the airport procedures; drastically cutting back time where a child would be absorbed into boredom.</p>\r\n<p>To avoid any embarrassing, tantrum-filled moments at the airport, there are five airport assistance services to book for an easy, smooth, relaxing, and enjoyable airport experience.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>1) Fast Track</strong></h3>\r\n<p>This is the best and the quickest way to complete airport procedures within minutes. Airports are the busiest during summer, which means long tiring lines at check-in, passport control, security, and customs. However, the fast track services offers you and your family top priority at all these airport procedures. Without this service, you can spend at least two hours in lines at major summer vacation destinations like Rome, Athens, Amsterdam, London, Bali, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, and others.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>2) Meet &amp; Assist</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The ideal way to pass through the airport is to be escorted personally from the terminal gate to boarding gate. This is a customizable service, where the representative will arrange facilities to meet the needs of your family. If you are new to an airport, unfamiliar with the local language, or disoriented at major airports, then the Meet &amp; Assist service is just for you and the family. It is your answer to all these situations. The representative will meet you at the curb, and escort the family through all the processes of the airport, and send you off without worrying that you will miss your flight.</p>\r\n<p>Vice versa, at arrival the agent will meet you at the plane exit and usher you through the airport procedures till you are safely in the awaiting vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>With the Meet &amp; Greet service you know your family&rsquo;s needs are taken care and you can sit back at relax.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>3) Cart Transport</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The aviation industry is expanding rapidly, which has resulted in massive airports across the globe, especially the busiest airports. If you are landing at any of these airports or taking off, you and your family needs cart transport inside the airport. It is a sure shot way your family remains together and reach the boarding gate without hassle or tiredness.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>4) Lounge Access</strong></h3>\r\n<p>While waiting for your flight to take off, the lounge is a great way to spend time with the family. You and the kids can unwind with delicious food, which has healthy, fun options for children. Indulge in juices, tea, coffee, desserts, meals, etc. Relax on the comfortable, padded couches, and reclining sofas. Major airports have some of the best lounges to relax with your family.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>5) Limousine</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Arrange for a pick up and drop facility to and from the airport. It ensures your family will reach the airport on time and assures you have a stress-free journey. One of the biggest problems is hailing a cab at a new destination to get you to your hotel. With this service, you do not have haggle with the driver or get dropped off at the wrong place.</p>\r\n<p>Let this summer, family vacation be filled with beautiful memories even while traveling.

It fills you with joy and reverence, but during Hajj, the Jeddah airport (JED) and Madinah airport (MED) are bustling with chaos. Long lines at every airport procedure and the convergence of people arriving from different continents are overwhelming. It drains you and leaves you with an exhausting, bad airport experience. However, you can avoid this taxing situation with fast track, meet &amp; assist, check-in assistance, access to the lounge and more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, who can book these services? There are mainly four categories of passengers arriving and departing from these Saudi Arabia-based airports. We list which services are ideal for them.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Family-Oriented Services:</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Traveling with children in a crowded airport is difficult. Once they are bored, they get frustrated, and long haul flight adds to changing moods. So, one of the best way to avoid these situations is to speed through the airport procedures with fast track&mdash;you are in and out the airport within minutes. However, at departure, a personal assistant will guide you to the play area or lounge, so you can unwind as a family while you wait for your flight.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Elderly Assistance: </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Airports are stressful for elderly, especially if they are first-time fliers. The long walk through the airport, waiting in lines, and lack of knowledge of airport layout is unnerving. Hence, meet &amp; assist is the service to book to avoid these circumstances. The representative will meet the passengers with their name at the end of the air bridge and assist them with all the airport processes, efficiently. Baggage handlers, lounge access, check-in assistance, flight monitoring, transport in the terminal, and escort to aircraft are the other services available to the elderly.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>VIP Services:</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the ultimate treatment offered to celebrities, diplomats, corporate, and whoever wishes to travel in luxury. The VIP service takes away the harrows at the airport and ensures privacy, comfort, and timely service. The VIP is treated with these services:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>Meeting you at the aircraft</li>\r\n<li>Private transportation is provided in case of remote parking</li>\r\n<li>All passport control formalities are conducted inside the VIP Lounge</li>\r\n<li>Porter Assistance</li>\r\n<li>Escort to the car</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Large Groups: </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most pilgrims travel in large groups for Hajj, which can be disorderly when people traverse the length of the airport at their own pace. To prevent any such scenarios, book airport assistance services such as meet &amp; assist, fast track, lounge access, or escort to and from the aircraft. The services guarantee everyone travels together, completing all the airport processes as a group.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.jeddahairportassistance.com/\">Jeddah Airport Assist</a> and <a href=\"/\">Madinah Airport Assist</a> offer these services to Hajj pilgrims.

In holidays people discover a lot of great things. But this is the only time when one can test their nerves, especially at the airports. You get caught by problems like bad weather, delays, lost-luggage, overcrowded airports, overbooked planes and a lot more. These things are not under your control but still, you can plan out ways to make your travel journey best this year.</p>\n<p>The overcrowded check-in areas, those strict and time-consuming security check-ups, the custom control check-ups are getting really very much stress-full these days. People are losing their interests and excitement about their holiday after boarding off from the airplane. No matter how seasoned a traveller you are, you would end up facing the same security problems and challenges of the air industry as everyone. In this article, we are sharing the top five tips that you should follow at the airport to make your holiday a stress-free one. So keep reading.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget any documents:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You do not want to get delayed in the airport once you have boarded off the plane. Crowd controlling in the airport is not in your hands but you can at least control those things which are in your hand. One of those things is having all the important documents for security purposes in the airport. Don't pack up your baggage in a hurry. Take your time and keep all important documents like passports, boarding passes, Visa documents etc. with you. You can also make a checklist and look it every time you go for a flight. It&rsquo;s very much important that you have a passport and an extra copy of your passport when flying internationally. If it&rsquo;s a domestic flight then your driving license will also work. You should also take pictures of your luggage and baggage to identify them easily. Keep all these things up to dated and your next trip is going to be awesome.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Check-in Beforehand:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Holiday means Vacation and Vacation means a huge rush of tourists and travelers. It is obvious that you do not want to wait for a long time at the airport before boarding the plane. You do not want to stand in a long queue for security and custom check-ups. It is advisable to come early at the airport to prevent long queues. But if you get caught in the crowd you can also go for the fast track service. <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance</strong> has got a fast track service. If you are taking this service from us then you need not stand in long lines. All the formalities will be done efficiently within no time and you can just relax before boarding on the plane. Thus, be early and smart.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Obey the rule of Carry-on:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are travelling to or from the United States, the body which is importantly indulged in determining your time from the airport entrance to your departure gate is the TSA or the Transportation Security Administration. If you have got a carry-on bag then you need to know the rules that the airline has made for those bags. Squeezing a large bag into the overhead storage bin will delay your journey as well as for many other after you. It is obvious that you will be forced to have a gate check for the bag and thus, you will be killing a lot of your time. There are many TSA rules about things that you can carry or leave behind while carrying abroad. Different airlines have got different rules and they are placed on their website. It is advisable to go through them to save your time &amp; hard earned ticket.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Do light Packing:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the best ways to avoid any confusion at the airport is to have as much less luggage as you can. The more bags and suitcases you have got, the more time is going to be killed. Just think of it. If you have got several bags then you have to carry all of them from the cab or train into the airport. Then you have to stand in long queues. Get each of your baggage weighed, inspected and X-rayed. The motive to say is that each bag will cause a delay for you. If you are going for a short vacation then just one to two carry-on bag will work. You can apply for <strong>MUrgency Baggage Assistance </strong>by visiting the &lsquo;Book Airport Service&rsquo; page<strong>.</strong> If you are going for some long vacation then plan your outfit carefully. Don't take things which you are not going to use. Think wisely and work according to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Get rid of jewelry and other items:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As soon as you arrive at the airports it is mandatory to cross the metal detector check-ups. It is recommended to get rid of all the major alarm triggers like change in your pocket, belts, etc. It will save a lot of your time especially when you have to catch two flights one after the other. Though you can wait in the line, the removal of these things takes a long time because you are under stress of the queue and it&rsquo;s in your head that because of you many passengers who all are behind you are getting delayed.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Book Airport Assistance:</strong></p>\n<p>Service Booking Form: https://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/service</p>\n<p>Email Us: MUAirportAssist@MUrgency.com</p>\n<p>WhatsApp: +1 650 308 9964</p>\n<p>Call: +971 50 462 7611</p>\n<p>Liked the article?

    "content": "<p>As we are in the middle of the Ramadan month, we hope that very soon many of our Muslim friends will be setting out for their lifetime&rsquo;s spiritual journey. You guessed it right, it's the Umrah Journey. If you are a newbie to it and are confused about the journey then you have come to the right place. In this article, we have provided some highly suggested travel tips which you should keep in mind for your upcoming trip. We hope that Allah makes your journey a memorable one as well as accepts your Umrah.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Basic Packing List: </strong>We are listing some of the most important things which you should keep with yourself when you are in your Umrah trip.</li>\n<li><strong>Umrah Guide: </strong>In the trip always keep a pocket-sized Umrah guide or a Hajj.</li>\n<li><strong>Pocket Quran:</strong> You can easily get a copy of the Quran from the mosque but it is recommended to have one with you. Don't forget to get it out from your pocket while going to the bathroom.</li>\n<li><strong>Prayer mat:</strong> You can get portable and lightweight prayer mats that can be easily kept in your bag. It can be used while praying and also serves as a sun shield.</li>\n<li><strong>Comfortable and loose fitting clothes:</strong> In this niche, the best-recommended clothes are those that can be easily washed and requires no ironing. Men can go with Indo-Pak Shalwar Qameez while women can go with Abaya. Don't forget to keep at least 2 pairs of slippers with you.</li>\n<li><strong>Gadgets:</strong> Make sure you either have a tablet or a smartphone with its charger and a universal adapter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>If you are with toddlers and kids: </strong>Always ensure that your kid has got an ID card with name and hotel card either pinned in their clothes or kept in their pocket. Buy toys and snacks for your kid so that they are less distracted and busy with them. You should also carry important medicines needed in the journey. It is also advised to get a hotel near Haram Sharif. If you want to go for Tawaf with toddlers then choose a time when it is least populated. You can easily know about it by watching the &ldquo;Quran-e-Karim&rdquo; channel in your hotel room. It broadcasts the live telecast of Haram Sharif. Even if your toddlers are able to walk use baby carriers while performing Tawaf for safety.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>If you are with elders:</strong> One point you should keep in mind at the very beginning is that elderly people who are sick should not be taken to the journey. Keep important medicines, antiseptic lotions, rehydration salts, sunburn lotions and analgesics for pain. Keep enough water for them. Don't let them get dehydrated. If they are on some medication don&rsquo;t forget to give them their medicines as prescribed. While performing Tawaf hold hands of one another. You can also opt for a wheelchair if walking is getting difficult for the elderly person in the group. It will also help you to perform Tawaf in the upper area where there are fewer crowds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be much emotional: </strong>The emotions of all the first-timers are very high. Because of this, they accept a lot of things said by strangers. It is important that you remain a bit careful as sometimes little things lead to larger dangers. If you have got any kind of query or confusion, do not hesitate to reach out to the assigned persons. There is a booth present outside the entrance of Haram where different scholars are present to answer all your issues. Never feel shy to talk to them. Also, remember that they may be strict towards you if you are found breaking some important rules of the rituals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Everything needs to be labeled: </strong>Don&rsquo;t forget to label Zamzam (holy water) and luggage that you are going to bring back after your prayers. Each person was allowed 10 litres of Zamzam earlier but now it&rsquo;s 5 litres. It can be taken only in a unique box which one can get from Makkah and Jeddah.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Saudi Sim Card is mandatory:</strong> If you are at Saudi Arabia then you can get a sim card and a connection at just 100 riyals. It is really very much common to get lost in the crowd so for safety and security purposes you should have a constant connection. All the incoming charges are free and outgoing calls are charged. At many places, men and women are set apart according to the rituals. Thus it is advised that every family member should have a phone with a connection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t leave your group:</strong> If it's your first time for the Umrah journey, then you will be discovering many new things in the country. There are chances that you may get lost. It is recommended to move in small groups or at least in pairs. One last bonus advice that we like to add is that never try to retrieve anything which you lost in the ground. It's a very crowded place and one can easily get trampled which may lead to injuries. Always try to get away from a crowded place and don&rsquo;t forget that your life is more important and irreplaceable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>In case you are looking for guidance &amp; assistance at the airport for yourself or your family members, you can contact <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance. </strong>We are always there to help you.

    "actualTitle": "7 tips to keep in mind while traveling in monsoon",
    "tags": "airport, airport assistance, travel tips, fast track, travel trends, monsoon",
    "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to the scorching heat &amp; welcome the pleasant &amp; cool monsoon showers. But as life is not a bed of roses, Monsoon too brings its own set of challenges. While you can choose to have a cup of coffee or hot tea on your window and enjoy the view of rain drops falling by, sometimes taking up journeys, official or personal, are unavoidable. Travelling in this season can really get slow &amp; uncomfortable &amp; that&rsquo;s where this article comes in.</p>\n<p>If you are planning to go somewhere this monsoon, we have brought you some tips that you should follow before you setting out on the upcoming journey.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick the right airplane seat: </strong>It is proved statistically that driving is much more dangerous than flying in the monsoon months. But if, on a flight, you are surrounded by thunderous and dark clouds you are going to worry a lot about yourself. You will be facing a lot of thuds, bumps, sudden lifts and drops by the airplane. But believe us; it's very normal to face that on a flight. But still, if you want to avoid those then select a seat that is much closer to the airplane's centre of gravity. There are two spots you can choose from. Either in the emergency exit row or right above the aircraft's wing. We guarantee it that you will have a much comfortable ride.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Obey the guidelines of your flight attendant:</strong> Though this tip seems to be the most common one it is the most important one. It is reported that during a turbulent flight one of the major reason for peoples getting hurt is not buckling themselves by the seat belt. Make sure that you follow all the guidelines given by your flight attendant. They have got a much better experience than you about a thunder flight. Follow each of their demonstrated steps accordingly and be safe.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Carry a First &ndash; Aid kit:</strong> As the monsoon season is a moisty season, there is a high chance of a bacterial infection. The diseases travel through water and air and the infection spread is really rapid. Keep bandages, antiseptic creams and disinfectant scrubs with you. Monsoon is a time when mosquitoes and bugs breed. In case, you experience any cuts or get hurt during the flight, do not hesitate to get in touch with the crew as a flight is always equipped with a first-aid kit &amp; the crew is trained for basic medical aid. Always remember that precaution is the best doctor.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Don't forget some entertaining stuff:</strong> As it is the monsoon season then it is quite obvious that there will be delays in flight. This will lead you to sit back at the airport for quite a long time. To kill your boredom it is advisable that you should carry some board games or digital games in your laptop or smartphone. You can also get a novel for yourself or some short story books if you are a book worm. If you are interested in watching movies or hearing songs then don&rsquo;t forget to download your favorites on your your laptop. But if you have forgotten to have them then don't worry. You can access the lounge services in the airport and take a shower, rest or even visit a spa for some enjoyment. For any further help, you can contact the <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Leave Early for the journey: </strong>Monsoon sometimes gets very much destructive and erratic. Because of it, there will definitely be certain interruptions in your journey. The roads may get blocked due to water or traffic jams may occur because of rain. Suppose you have got to reach the airport and if you get caught in the traffic then you may miss your flight. It is advisable to leave your home early. Take at least 3 hours in hand. Ensure your lodging and airplane terminal exchanges are solid and steady for postponements. For any kind of assistance, you can contact the <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance.</strong> So Keep calm, plan in advance &amp; enjoy your journey.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Keep snacks with you:</strong> As said earlier that the monsoon season is the time for the growth of bacterial infections. It is advisable that you should prevent streets foods as much as you can. Keep healthy and nutritious foods like dry fruits, fruits, etc. to eat. Be away from raw foods as well. If you are at the airport then you can go for tasty delicacies provided at the restaurants there. They are absolutely bacterial free. Lastly, don't forget your water bottle. Have surplus water with you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Have the right attire:</strong> Last but not the least, have some perfect sets of clothes if you are traveling in the monsoon season. Do not keep whites and pastels in your backpack. Instead, you should go with pants which are dark in color and long sleeves clothes. Don't forget to wear rain-proof shoes. Load your backpack with raincoat and umbrella. Keep extra inner wears and most importantly have a waterproof bag.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How To Book Airport Assistance:</strong></p>\n<p>Service Booking Form: https://www.murgencyairportassistance.com/service</p>\n<p>Email Us: MUAirportAssist@MUrgency.com</p>\n<p>WhatsApp: +1 650 308 9964</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call: +971 50 462 7611</p>\n<p>Liked the article?

    "content": "<p>Traveling across the world is important for the physical and mental development of a person. It makes people well accustomed with diverse people and their interests. Travelling also enriches the mind with happiness and prosperity. One need not wait long to experience this diversity. It just starts at the airport. While traveling, you have to give some of your precious time at check-ins, custom and security checking and you will be facing different kinds of travelers who will either make your journey amusing or difficult. Here we have 7 types of people whom you have either met or will be going to face while standing in a queue at the airport. So go through the article and let us know about the ones whom you have already met in the past.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Late Passenger</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;This category of passengers include those people who are in full stress and tension of missing their flight. They are really in a great rush and just want to get away from all kind of formalities at the airport. These people are always seen asking people in the queue to allow them to get before them. They have presumably had a harsh day, and there is no compelling reason to make it any harder on them. Anybody can get late at the airport, it&rsquo;s not a new thing. We at <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance</strong> are always present to provide you with Fast Track services if you are in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The Early Passengers</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are those passengers who have touched the airport doors 2 hours before they load up because failing to catcha&nbsp; flight is a real nightmare for them. Tragically, this frequently implies the plane before them has not yet boarded, so they are compelled to stroll around the air terminal capriciously, and likely wind up spending more cash than they have to on espresso, sustenance or travel cushions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The Class Trip</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a gathering of youngsters with very few grown-up supervision. They are going on an outing through church, school or camp and they presumably have coordinating shirts and informal IDs. One will find it amazing to see the whole team with matching clothes standing in the queue. But on the other hand, people standing after them will feel irritated because of a long wait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>The Seasonal Passenger</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These passengers go for a lot of trips across the year. They know everything about the airport and the most ideal approach to explore the air terminal. They are generally glad to address your inquiries if you are lost or confounded and may even give us close competition in airport assistance services. They likely have a bag that stands out because they don't have sufficient energy to manage lost baggage - they need to get their next flight you see!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>The Super Loud Family</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This family is likely going on a family excursion for some kind of school break. Thus, the kids are excessively energized and most likely going around-regardless of the time. The guardians are boisterously talking among themselves, which leaves the eldest cousins or kin to keep an eye on mischievous children. On the other hand, the older member of the family is getting annoyed by standing and waiting at the airport. They are continuously busy in complaining against the services of the airport and things that need to be done to improve them. If you will be meeting any such families then just help them by suggesting the <strong>MUrgency Assistance</strong> services. We at MUrgency Airport Assistance will provide all help and need that we can.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>The Businessperson</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These category of people are very much common in the airport. Every now and then one will easily notice at least one of them either busy with their smartphone or with their tablets. These people are like super busy. They are preparing their document in the laptop, talking to clients in the smartphone, making notes in their notepad and guess what, all of them are being done simultaneously. They don&rsquo;t want to waste any moment of their time and want everything to be done fast. These people hate delays and standing in long queues for hours. We at <strong>MUrgency Assistance</strong> provide VIP Services as well as the gate to gate transfer to solve such problems. Feel free to contact us anytime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>The Eager Tourist</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This category of passengers includes those who are on their first trip. They are on their holiday dress coat, different luggage bags, maps on the hand, etc. They are very much excited about the trip. But as it is their first trip they are a bit confused at the airport to find the in's and out's and to go through all the airport formalities. They are asking other passengers for some suggestions and finding their way somehow. If you are also planning for your first trip then for any assistance you can visit the <strong>MUrgency Airport Assistance</strong>.

    "content": "<p>Hajj is a holy journey of Muslims to the blessed city of Makkah located in Saudi Arabia, during Islamic Calender&rsquo;s last month, Dhul Hijjah. It is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam which if possible then every Muslims should follow. It is viewed as the world's biggest gathering of Muslim people, recording practically 2.4 million travelers in 2018. This year, Hajj starts on August 9 and it goes on for four to six days.</p>\n<p>Since the occasion sees a people influx from all over the world especially Middle East Countries, it is imperative to be prepared for the upcoming travel, be it booking the right airport assistance services or carrying the right accessories for a comfortable travel. Luckily, this article does exactly that for you so read on.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Preparation for Hajj</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since Hajj is an ideal encounter for the vast majority, the significance of satisfactory and early planning can't be over-accentuated. One needs some investment of time, money and physical effort for the journey. The information about Hajj must be gathered, schedules must be worked out, and reports must be prepared. The reason for these arrangements isn't just to limit physical distress, monetary expenses, and emotional aggravation, yet in addition to empowering you to perform Hajj with peace of mind and heart. Hence, one should be ready for the journey of self-revelation, self-evaluation and spiritual enlightenment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Travel Rule with Documentation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the government of Saudi Arabia, the passport needs to be valid for at least a half year past the date of your takeoff. Check it right now and if it is not then either apply for a new one or get the validity of your passport extended.</li>\n<li>If you are a \"green card\" holder from the U.S. then also the above rules apply to you.</li>\n<li>You will require a round-trip ticket to Saudi Arabia to get a Hajj visa.</li>\n<li>Have an extra four to five duplicates of the photographs made and carry them along with you to Saudi Arabia. They might be required for ID cards issued by your muallim and for other Saudi records and systems. Having extra pictures close by will spare you the time, irritation and cost associated with having them made in a remote land.</li>\n<li>If you were born and brought up in the U.S.A., you might be required to have an authentication issued by a proficient specialist (The Imam) expressing that you are a Muslim. Since non-Muslims are not permitted in the blessed urban communities of Mecca and Medina, such a record is of critical significance, particularly if you lack a typical Muslim name.</li>\n<li>Set up a Last Will and Testament and have it appropriately authenticated. Counsel a lawyer if it is a complex will, or if you are worried about your property and assets in case something unexpected occurs during Hajj. Leave the original documents in a security box available to an individual from your family. The agent/executrix of your will ought to likewise be given a duplicate, and your lawyer should also hold a duplicate too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Medication and Vaccination</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Medication:</strong></p>\n<p>Infection related to respiration and digestion is way too much common during Hajj. Individuals from everywhere throughout the world carry with them a wide range of diseases and the unavoidable closeness of a huge number of travelers encourages the simple spread of these sicknesses. Weariness and absence of rest from the physically requesting routine of Hajj bring down one's resistance and immunity, subsequently making one progressively defenseless against these diseases. Take early precaution to avoid potential risk &amp; limit your chances of ending up sick. Getting and remaining fit as a fiddle by ordinary exercise preceding your flight is a decent initial step. You can likewise carry certain medications with you for utilizing later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refer to your family doctor and tell him to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic for your journey to Saudi Arabia. Generally, it is seen that the doctors prescribe CIPRO antibiotics be taken 250mg per day. Some people also carry AMOXICILLIN to the country.</li>\n<li>List of some of the most important emergency drug one should have with them are:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>TYLENOL PM (for sleeping-aid)</li>\n<li>ASPIRIN, ADVIL, TYLENOL or ALEVE (for pain)</li>\n<li>ASPERCREME, BENGAY (for muscular pain)</li>\n<li>EMETROL (for nausea)</li>\n<li>IMMODIUM, PEPTOBISMOL (for diarrhea)</li>\n<li>MULTI-VITAMINS, COUGH DROPS, BAND-AIDS, ANTI-BACTERIAL CREAM (for cuts)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Vaccination:</strong></p>\n<p>One requires certain vaccination to be eligible for a Hajj visa. The World Health Organization (WHO) issues yearly rules and prerequisites about vaccination for movement to different nations including Saudi Arabia. You can have a check at their website. Your doctor will have the essential data or will most likely access it promptly.</p>\n<p>Make certain to get an official Vaccination Record Book (the \"Yellow Book\") from your County or State Health Department. Have your doctor to fill, stamp and sign on it. Anything less might be inadmissible to the authorities providing Saudi visa, and you don't need your visa application rejected for a little reason like this. Keep the &ldquo;Yellow Book&rdquo; with your other significant documents which you are going to take to Saudi Arabia. No one can tell when you may require it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Things to have with you</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below is the list of some of the most important thing one requires for a convenient, safe and care-free journey in Saudi Arabia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ihram </strong>&ndash; It is a two-piece cloth which is unsewn, plain and white made up of 100 percent cotton. Saudi Arabia is a warm country and during Hajj you will perspire a lot. This is a cool cloth and will keep your body airy.</li>\n<li><strong>Fanny Pouch </strong>&ndash; This is a small waist pouch which you can put around your waist to keep valuable items during the hajj.</li>\n<li><strong>Money </strong>&ndash; As Saudi Arabia is a rich country you will face a lot of expenses. Keep heavy amount with you to cover them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope that the above article will be useful to you for your Hajj journey. As it is the Hajj month, the airports &amp; flights leading to Jeddah are going to be really packed up.

    "content": "<p>Gone are the days when arriving early at #Airport meant long waiting hours with nothing to do while awaiting the boarding call. Airports have evolved a lot since then where passengers can buy a slice of the culture of the city by visiting the souvenir stores at the airport. Add to it, duty free shopping of apparels, electronics &amp; restaurants that take you on a gastronomic journey, you would just wish you have a few more hours at the airport.</p>\n<p>In this article, we try to cover to a few of the best restaurants across the airports in the world which have become popular over a period of time due to their exquisite taste &amp; rich history. Let's continue reading this article to get accustomed to some of the most popular restaurants across the World Airports.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>PIQUILLO &ndash; John F Kennedy International Airport</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This one is regarded as one of the very first Tapas serving restaurant to start in the airport in America. One can have a taste of several items of food in a single meal while taking Tapas. To get the full out of it try Tapas with a glass of wine. Some of our suggestions for you are Embutidos platter which consists of Spanish meat, Almejas Marineras along with white wine and Calamares A La Plancha which has crispy calamari.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>ONE FLEW SOUTH &ndash; Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This restaurant is the busiest one in the New York-based airport. The airport was established in 1998 and it is estimated that it handles 260,000 travelers every day. The restaurant is popular to serve tourists with foods famous in South Asian countries. This dazzling restaurant is beautified by Georgia pinewood, white leather and marbles. Every tired explorer can sit back into the restaurant and relax by trying some of the best-mixed drinks with a plate of pork belly sliders. Some of our recommendations are burger from Concourse &lsquo;e&rsquo;, Kobe beef with goat cheddar and shitake mushrooms. If you are not comfortable with burgers and sandwiches then don&rsquo;t worry, the restaurant consists of a good bar serving sushi. Enjoy your time here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>HUNG&rsquo;S DELICACIES &ndash; Hong Kong International Airport</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you belong to the group of foodies then you would be well accustomed with the word &ndash; Michelin star. This title is given to restaurants which are outstanding in every way. Hung's delicacies were established by Chef Lai Wai-Hung in 2003. It didn&rsquo;t take much to get popular among the people of Hong Kong. Chef Hung was known for his outstanding skills with marinades. But due to some rental issues he needed to shut down his restaurant in 2014. A second restaurant with the same name serving Chinese foods like marinated duck tongues, five spied beef shanks, braised goose, etc. was opened in the Honk Kong's airport. Till now it is the most popular one among the tourists at the airport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>PLANE FOOD &ndash; London&rsquo;s Heathrow Airport</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gordon Ramsey is one of the most popular chefs in the world. He is also a holder of the Michelin star. This British chef has over thirty restaurants present across the world. One of them is present at Heathrow airport.
