    "description": "We would like to congratulate and thank team of MUrgency for helping so professionally our mother inlaw who was returning alone to Ahmedabad on Etihad airways. She is not proficient with air travels, has hearing problem and speaks only gujarati and hindi. Our worry was her transit stop at Abu Dhabi. How would she go through all that process of security, checking-in for departure, etc. MUrgency arranged a Hindi speaking Greeter at Abu Dhabi who was waiting to help her. Our mother inlaw has been very happy with the help she received by this Greeter in Abu Dhabi. And hats off to MUrgency team for updating us with information on what was going on with our mother inlaw by constantly mailing us all the way to the departure time, she even informed us on the flight delay! Many thanks to MUrgency and staff for such a wonderful setup.\n",

    "description": "I have used Murgency services twice now whilst on holidays in China May/June 2016. I chose them because I was travelling with my 82 year old father who could not walk very fast and I suspected the airports in China would be large, time consuming and daunting. I was right. Using these services was a life saver and a stress saver. At all times Murgency were efficient with communications and everything went smoothly from meeting at the airport door or tarmac, waiting in VIP lounges to assistance finding luggage and delivery to your hotel door. It worked just as well in reverse order navigating the huge airports, helping with language problems, finding the shortest possible queues. A highly recommended service.\n",
